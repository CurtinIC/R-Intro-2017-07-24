  The goal of this workshop is to teach novice programmers to write modular code 
  and best practices for using R for data analysis. 
  R is commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis 
  and its array of third-party packages. The emphasis of these materials is to give 
  attendees a strong foundation in the fundamentals of R, and to teach best practices 
  for scientific computing: breaking down analyses into modular units, task automation, 
  and encapsulation.
  <br>
   This hands-on workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the programming 
  language R, and will not teach statistical analysis.
